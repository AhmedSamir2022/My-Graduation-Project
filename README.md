# My-Graduation-Project
Graduation Project (ADAS System) | Mentored by SwiftAct
• The major goal of this project is to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians by implementing safety-related ADAS
features (DMS and AEB) and obtaining an economical solution using computer vision techniques.
• The system is implemented and integrated using the Jetson Nano kit for running image processing and deep learning
models.The Jetson as well as the ECUs interface with the CAN bus.
• Interfaced with STM32 Cortex M3 based microcontroller and wrote MCAL drivers for essential peripherals such as RCC,
GPIO, NVIC, SysTick, EXTI, PWM, USART, I2C.
• Developed CAN Controller Driver and used it as a Communication Protocol between ECUs.
• Implemented PID to Control the speed of motors.
• made the hardware design for the prototype of the system.
